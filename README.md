# CV

CV website HTML training

## Description

This repository contains the source code for a CV (Curriculum Vitae) website. The purpose of this project is to practice and improve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by creating a personal CV website. It also contains a simple cookie clicker game where you click a picture of a cookie and it counts the clicks, try and beat your record. I have also added a basic space invaders style game with blocks instead of nice looking ships since I don't know how to make that yet.
