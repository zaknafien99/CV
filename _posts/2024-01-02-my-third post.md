Welcome to my new blog! This is my third post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

This blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's a great way to create a simple, fast, and secure blog.

I'll be writing about web development, software engineering, and other tech-related topics. Stay tuned for more!

I've updated this with the help of Google's Jules. Though I have made something similar following a tutorial on github.
